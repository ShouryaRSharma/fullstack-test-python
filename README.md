- Credit will be given for approach, correctness, clean code, and testing.
- You can take as long as you like to complete the exercise, but for an indicative timescale we expect a senior developer can accomplish this in an hour.
- Please do not use external libraries (except for a testing library)
- You may of course use any resources you like to assist you with specific techniques, syntax etc - but please do not just copy code.
- Please don't share this exercise with anyone else :)
